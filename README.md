## Installation & Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Generate your own dictionary with main_build_dict.py / main_data_tokenizer.py
2. Train your model with main_train_json.py

CUTIE achieves best performance with rows/cols well configured. For more insights, refer to statistics in the file (others/TrainingStatistic.xlsx).

## TLDR

For information about the input example, refer to [issue discussion](https://github.com/vsymbol/CUTIE/issues/7).
- Apply any OCR tool that help you detecting and recognizing words in the scanned document image.
- Label image OCR results with key information class as the .json file in the invoice_data folder. (thanks to @4kssoft)

To create json input file using Tesseract OCR:
    python3 tesseractOCR.py -i path-to-image -l language > ouput.json
e.g:
python3 tesseractOCR.py -i ./invoice_data/Faktura1.pdf_0.jpg -l pol > Faktura1.json
